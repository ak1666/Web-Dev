(Yeah, what you want?) <br>What you want from me?<br>
Yeah, what you want? Huh<br>

[Chorus]<br>
What you want from me? (SK-K-KY)<br>
Yeah, what you want? Huh (Woo)<br>
What you want from me? Hey (Woo)<br>
I took a break but I'm back on my bullshit (Yeah)<br>
I got a Scat and I'm back on that cool shit (Skrrt)<br>
She pull up on me, she want me in dat coochie<br>
I hit Chanelly, we don't shop at Gucci (No way)<br>
Every time I take an L, bitch, I learn<br>
I ain't pick sides, I ain't rock with no sherm (Go)<br>
You can get hit with that thang, hit yo' perm<br>
Slow off these Percs, bitch, I feel like a worm<br>
Bitch, I be geeked, you can call me a "nerd"<br>
I got the Issey Miyake jeans and a Chrome Heart tee, it sit on my shirt (Woo)<br>
Flawless diamonds, these is pearls<br>
Bitch, I be high with the guys, with the birds (Brr)<br>
I was just nodding off in that Porsche (Woo), yeah, bitch, I done ran off on the curb<br>
Bitch, I'm gon' pull up to shows and I turn up (Turn up)<br>
You knew what I said, bitch, you know that you heard me<br>
24/7 we geeked up, 7/11 double cup, my vision been blurry<br>


[Verse]<br>
My money tall, my money fat, my money thick, my money sturdy<br>
My twizzy gon' pull up from long-range<br>
Hit him thirty times, yeah, calling him "Curry"<br>
My hands clean<br>
I don't gotta do nothing for me, all my twizzy gon' shoot for me<br>
They on payroll, I don't even gotta pull the trigger<br>
Shit start to get wonky (Woo), this shit get flooky (Yeah)<br>
I need a couples Percs before I get mad, get moody<br>
My OnlyFans bitch boutta pull up, we make a movie<br>
I rock Balenciaga with some Truey (Balenci', Balenci')<br>
My bitch pull up, we fucking, yeah, she sucking, she get gooey (Ack)<br>
She suck me, it sound good, it got me like ooh-wee<br>
My diamonds hitting crazy, they so hard, they were like twenty each (Twenty each)<br>
All I did was just stay down and out the way and now I'm so stupid rich<br>
Hold on (Buh, buh, buh, buh), I ain't new to this<br>
Every time I took my shot (Buh, buh, buh, buh), I went stupid, bitch (Brr)<br>
I can't take no L, all I take is dubs<br>
I call Eliante, get my diamond polished up<br>
